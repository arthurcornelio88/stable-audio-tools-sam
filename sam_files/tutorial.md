# Preparing dataset for fine-tuning S.A.M. model

Weâ€™ll explain how to proceed with the creation of the dataset to fine-tune our S.A.M. model !

## 1 - Prepare the environment
- in Google Colab:
  - Open a new Google Colab and clone the repository, running this code below in a blank cell:
    - `!gh repo clone arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam`
  - Keep going on "1 - Prepare the environment.ipynb" notebook
- in local (downloaded repository) :
  - Go ahead to the first notebook "1 - Prepare the environment.ipynb"

## 2 - Filtering the scrapped dataset to a dataframe (.csv)

- Open and run [Cleaning and filtering scrapped dataset.ipynb](changer)

## 3 - Creation of JSON files (.json)

- Open and run [Creating JSON files.ipynb](changer)

## 4 - Downloading and renaming the audio files (.mp3)
