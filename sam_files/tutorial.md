# Preparing dataset for fine-tuning S.A.M. model

Weâ€™ll explain how to proceed with the creation of the dataset to fine-tune our S.A.M. model !

We have four main steps : 

1) Filtering the scrapped dataset to a dataframe (.csv)
2) Creation of JSON files (.json)
3) Downloading and renaming the audio files (.mp3)
4) Verifying audio files, JSON files and dataframe
