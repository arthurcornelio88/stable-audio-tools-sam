# Preparing dataset for fine-tuning S.A.M. model

We’ll explain how to proceed with the creation of the dataset to fine-tune our S.A.M. model !

## 1 - Prepare the environment
- in Google Colab:
  - Open a new Google Colab and clone the repository, running this code below in a blank cell:
    - `!gh repo clone arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam`
  - Keep going on [1 - Prepare the environment.ipynb](https://github.com/arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam/blob/main/sam_files/notebooks/dataset%20for%20fine-tuning/1%20-%20Prepare%20environment.ipynb) notebook
- in local (downloaded repository) :
  - Go ahead to the first notebook [1 - Prepare the environment.ipynb](https://github.com/arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam/blob/main/sam_files/notebooks/dataset%20for%20fine-tuning/1%20-%20Prepare%20environment.ipynb), located at
  - `sam_files/notebooks/dataset for fine-tuning`

### **Attetion! Don't do "run all cells" in these notebooks.** !

## 2 - Filtering the scrapped dataframe (.csv)

- Open and run [2 - Cleaning and filtering scrapped dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam/blob/main/sam_files/notebooks/dataset%20for%20fine-tuning/2%20-%20Cleaning%20and%20filtering%20scrapped%20dataset.ipynb)

## 3 - Creation of JSON files (.json)

- Open and run [3 - Creating JSON files.ipynb](https://github.com/arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam/blob/main/sam_files/notebooks/dataset%20for%20fine-tuning/3%20-%20Creating%20JSON%20files.ipynb)

## 4 - Downloading and renaming the audio files (.mp3)

- Open and run [4 - Downloading and renaming the audio files (.mp3).ipynb](https://github.com/arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam/blob/main/sam_files/notebooks/dataset%20for%20fine-tuning/4%20-%20Downloading%20and%20renaming%20the%20audio%20files%20(.mp3)%20copy.ipynb)

## 5 - Uploading to S.A.M. bucket

- Open and run [5 - Uploading to S.A.M. bucket.ipynb](https://github.com/arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam/blob/main/sam_files/notebooks/dataset%20for%20fine-tuning/5%20-%20Uploading%20to%20S.A.M.%20drive.ipynb)

Bravo !
