# Preparing dataset for fine-tuning S.A.M. model

Weâ€™ll explain how to proceed with the creation of the dataset to fine-tune our S.A.M. model !

## 1 - Prepare the environment
- in Google Colab:
  - Open a new Google Colab and clone the repository, running this code below in a blank cell:
    - `!gh repo clone arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam`
  - Keep going on "1 - Prepare the environment.ipynb" notebook
- in local (downloaded repository) :
  - Go ahead to the first notebook "1 - Prepare the environment.ipynb"., located at
  - `sam_files/notebooks/dataset for fine-tuning`

# **Attetion! Don't do "run all cells" in these notebooks.** !

## 2 - Filtering the scrapped dataset to a dataframe (.csv)

- Open and run [2 - Cleaning and filtering scrapped dataset.ipynb]([https://github.com/arthurcornelio88/stable-audio-tools-sam/blob/main/sam_files/notebooks/dataset%20for%20fine-tuning/2%20-%20Cleaning%20and%20filtering%20scrapped%20dataset.ipynb])

## 3 - Creation of JSON files (.json)

- Open and run [Creating JSON files.ipynb](changer)

## 4 - Downloading and renaming the audio files (.mp3)

- Open and run [Downloading and renaming the audio files (.mp3).ipynb](changer)

## 5 - 5 - Uploading to S.A.M. bucket

- Open and run [Uploading to S.A.M. bucket.ipynb](changer)
